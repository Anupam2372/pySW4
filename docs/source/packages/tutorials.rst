pySW4 Tutorials
===============

This section includes IPython Notebooks with documented examples of
pySW4's capabilities. Some of the notebooks process output from the
``sw4-v1.1/examples/rfile`` example, qhich uses the USGS Bay Area
Velocity Model. The original input file can be found in the sw4-v1.1/examples/rfile directory, also on `SW4's GitHub repository
<https://github.com/geodynamics/sw4/tree/master/examples/rfile>`_. However to generate the output used in these tutorial notebooks run the simulation again with `this <https://github.com/shaharkadmiel/pySW4/blob/master/tutorials/berkeley.sw4>`_ input file.
